# Contributing to YatraMate

First off, thank you for considering contributing to YatraMate! It's people like you that make YatraMate such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, [make one](https://github.com/soumyajiitdas/YatraMate-VehicleRentalSystem/issues/new)! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

### Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then [fork YatraMate](https://github.com/soumyajiitdas/YatraMate-VehicleRentalSystem/fork) and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #38 is the ticket you're working on):

```sh
git checkout -b 38-add-awesome-feature
```

### Get the test suite running

Make sure you're able to run the tests. We've got `npm test` in both the `client` and `server` directories. We'd love to see you add tests with your code.

### Did you find a bug?

*   **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/soumyajiitdas/YatraMate-VehicleRentalSystem/issues).

*   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/soumyajiitdas/YatraMate-VehicleRentalSystem/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Do you have a suggestion?

*   We're always looking for suggestions to improve YatraMate. If you have an idea, please open an issue and describe your suggestion.
